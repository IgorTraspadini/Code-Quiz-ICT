# Code Quiz
## About the Project
In this Challenge, you'll create a timed, multiple-choice coding quiz that can keep track of high scores and quiz-takers' initials.

Here are the requirements:
- GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
- WHEN I click the start button
- THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
- WHEN I answer a question
- THEN I am presented with another question
- WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
- THEN time is subtracted from the clock
- WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
- THEN the game is over
- WHEN the game is over
- THEN I can save my initials and score
